        I’m <strong>Oleh Hebel</strong>, a designer from Ukraine. Many of my friends and relatives are serving right now.
        This site is both my studio and a way to send targeted help to them.

        <li>Any amount matters — even <strong>1&nbsp;$</strong> covers a small but very real need at the front.</li>
        <li>Donations go to verified units and people I personally know for gear, drones, communication and medical support.</li>
        <li>You have my real contacts here. I answer everyone and report how funds are spent.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p class="donate-subtitle">
        When you donate here, you support my work as a designer and, at the same time, help my brothers and sisters in uniform
        have a better chance to come back home.
